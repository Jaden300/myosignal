When motor units beneath the electrode fire synchronously, the summed electrical field is large enough to be detected through skin, subcutaneous fat, and fascia. The result is a time-varying voltage signal: flat at rest, bursting during contraction.",

Does the signal return to baseline immediately when you stop, or does it decay gradually? What happens to the graph when you click the same gesture repeatedly - does it look the same each time?",

Students draw three waveforms - one flat (rest), one smooth and slow, one rapid and jagged - and record the feature values for each.",

Introduce myojam as a specific implementation: a system that reads forearm EMG and classifies 6 gestures to control a computer cursor.",

const QUIZ_QUESTIONS = [
  {
    question: "Where is the electrical signal that EMG measures actually generated?",
    options: ["In the brain's motor cortex","At the neuromuscular junction and muscle fibre membrane","In the tendon connecting muscle to bone","In the skin surface beneath the electrode"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "EMG records the summed electrical activity of muscle fibre action potentials. These are triggered at the neuromuscular junction when motor neurons release acetylcholine, causing depolarisation along the muscle fibre membrane - not in the brain or tendon."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does a stronger muscle contraction produce a larger amplitude EMG signal?",
    options: ["The muscle fibres physically move closer to the electrode","More motor units are recruited and fire simultaneously","The electrode gains more electrical charge from friction","The sampling rate increases with contraction force"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Larger force requires recruiting more motor units. When more motor units fire simultaneously, their individual electrical fields sum together, producing a larger detectable voltage at the surface electrode. This is called spatial summation."
  },
  {
    question: "What does the Zero Crossing Rate (ZC) feature primarily capture about an EMG signal?",
    options: ["The average energy of the signal","The total signal length or path","A proxy for the frequency content of the signal","The time between bursts of activity"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "ZC counts how often the signal crosses zero. A high-frequency signal crosses zero many times per second; a low-frequency signal crosses few times. ZC is therefore a proxy for frequency content - cheaper to compute than a full spectral analysis."
  },
  {
    question: "A myojam window contains 200 samples recorded at 200Hz. How long is that window in time?",
    options: ["0.1 seconds","0.5 seconds","1 second","2 seconds"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Time = samples / sample rate = 200 / 200 = 1 second. This is myojam's window length - each classification uses exactly one second of EMG data."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is NOT a source of noise in a surface EMG signal?",
    options: ["Powerline interference at 50/60Hz","Cross-talk from neighbouring muscles","The electrode's distance from the motor cortex","Motion artefacts from electrode movement"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Surface EMG detects local muscle fibre activity - it doesn't measure anything from the motor cortex directly. The cortex is the source of the motor command, but what EMG captures is the downstream effect at the muscle level. The electrode's distance from the cortex is irrelevant."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of the 20–90Hz bandpass filter applied to myojam's EMG signal?",
    options: ["To increase the signal amplitude for easier detection","To remove DC drift and high-frequency noise while preserving gesture information","To convert the analogue signal to a digital one","To synchronise the signal with the classifier's 200Hz sample rate"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Useful EMG gesture information lives between roughly 20–90Hz. Below 20Hz you get electrode movement artefacts and DC drift; above 90Hz you get amplifier noise. The Butterworth bandpass filter removes both without introducing timing distortion."
  },
  {
    question: "Surface EMG electrodes are placed on skin, not inside the muscle. What limitation does this introduce?",
    options: ["The signal is too strong to record accurately","The signal picks up activity from multiple nearby muscles, causing cross-talk","The electrodes can only detect rest, not contraction","The sampling rate is limited to 20Hz at the skin surface"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Surface electrodes pick up the summed electrical field from all motor units within detection range - which often spans multiple muscles. This means a ring finger flex also partially activates signals from middle and pinky muscles, blurring the classification problem."
  },
  {
    question: "A student draws a flat, nearly horizontal line in the Signal Playground. Which feature would you expect to be highest relative to other drawn signals?",
    options: ["MAV (Mean Absolute Value)","RMS (Root Mean Square)","ZC (Zero Crossing Rate)","WL (Waveform Length)"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "A flat line oscillating near zero would cross zero frequently if it has any noise at all, giving a relatively high ZC. MAV and RMS would be very low (little energy), and WL would also be low (little variation between samples). But actually - for a truly flat signal all features approach zero; ZC would be highest relatively because any tiny fluctuation crosses zero multiple times. In the playground, rapidly jagged signals have the highest ZC."
